We followed this tutorial: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1 in its entirety

This made an application with the ability the following screens:
Meal Table View Screen: a list with a small image view of each meal, as well as its ratings and name
Meal Edit/ New Meal Screen: same screen can either create a new meal where you can add photo/name/rating or can adjust the settings of a previously defined meal

We then updated the updated the app to the following:
It is now an app for ratings on dog breeds!
The app also takes care of the pesky incident where photos that are not totally square are no longer distorted into a forced square
Also, when inserting a new dog breed, it will insert the breed into the table view at the correct location such that breeds are sorted by rating - cuz who doesn't want their favorite dog on top?!
