#What we attempted to build
We followed this tutorial: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1 in its entirety, so this repo is very reflective of the code written there

This made an application with the ability the following screens:
Meal Table View Screen: a list with a small image view of each meal, as well as its ratings and name
Meal Edit/ New Meal Screen: same screen can either create a new meal where you can add photo/name/rating or can adjust the settings of a previously defined meal

We then updated the updated the app to the following:
It is now an app for ratings on dog breeds!
The app also takes care of the pesky incident where photos that are not totally square are no longer distorted into a forced square
Also, when inserting a new dog breed, it will insert the breed into the table view at the correct location such that breeds are sorted by rating - cuz who doesn't want their favorite dog on top?!

#Who did what

Cristina did parts: (Part 1)Build a Basic UI, Connect the UI to Code (together in class), Define Your Data Model, (Part 2) Create a Table View, Implement Navigation, Implement Edit and Delete Behavior, (After tutorial) refactored to dog breeds and fixed photo distortion

Lauren did parts: (Part 1) Connect the UI to Code (together in class), Work with View Controllers, Implement a Custom Control, (Part 2) Persist Data, (After tutorial) implemented logic so that ratings are ordered correctly in the table view

#What you learned
Lauren: I learned a lot more about the XCode simulator than I had previously known. I had also never coded in Swift before, and have also never used a language where half of it involved physically dragging and dropping elements in a GUI like fashion. For me, I did not like this style of coding since I felt as though I had less control over how different components interacted with each other. I would rather have written out in code how each component interacted rather then dragged and dropped connections and used dropdown menus. I had also never created a mobile app before so this was a a very interesting experience, which I thought would have been more like designing a website.

#What didn't work
Lauren: Again because of dragging and dropping to make connections, if I were to make one mistake when I initially connected different features, this would introduce a lot of bugs later down the line, and then when I would attempt to remedy it in a quick-fix, this would introduce more bugs, so I would end up deleting the entire feature and starting over to make the connection correct again. I found Swift to be very unforgiving in that sense. Also learning a new language and following a tutorial, I find that a lot of the nuances of what the code actually means are a bit lost.
